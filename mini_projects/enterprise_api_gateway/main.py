# Master Challenge: Enterprise API Gateway
# **Build a comprehensive API Gateway that:**
# 1. **Routes requests** to multiple backend services
# 2. **Handles authentication** across different auth methods
# 3. **Implements rate limiting** per client/endpoint
# 4. **Provides caching** with intelligent invalidation
# 5. **Monitors health** of backend services
# 6. **Recovers automatically** from failures
# 7. **Logs and metrics** for all requests
# 8. **Real-time dashboard** showing system status
